==============
Note: This project is part of the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree program.

Sparkify is a music streaming startup and as part of their growth, they want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. 

In this project, a cloud datawarehouse is build. Source data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket, staged into Redshift and transformed into a star scheme. The star scheme is then used by the Sparkify analytics team to understand user behaviour.
